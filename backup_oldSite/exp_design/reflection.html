       <p>My ideas about experiential design have evolved significantly since the beginning of this course. Before the course began, I had basic ideas about design and its process, and knew the basics about aesthetics and step-by-step process of experiential design. On completion of projects, I have performed an informal evaluation of the client and my own techniques and processes in order that I learn and develop my practice. I think of this reflection as a stylistic approach I will carry on as I learn to utilise different design models. The necessity to evaluate one’s own performance has been emphasised as I have progressed throughout the course and having projects and experiences that can be compared have been fundamental to my personal development. </p>
       <p>The lectures and tutorial classes from the first two weeks of the course have helped me to begin piecing the puzzle together. I’ve started to form solid opinions of the design process based on a firm grounding of researched theories encompassing a variety of elements eg. psychology and the use of colour. In turn, confidence in my own ability has grown, not only confidence in design but assurance that I am able to solve problems independently and work professionally in a disciplined way. At this stage, I am under no illusions that there is much to learn, but look forward to the challenges. Reflecting on past learning experiences, I definitely think of myself as a practical and creative person, able to communicate ideas and always pushing the limits of what I can achieve. </p>
    <p>The other key part of reflecting upon one’s own performance is of course honesty when identifying weakness and working to overcome criticism. A habit that sometimes gets the better of me is choosing to complete work that I enjoy doing before that of work I enjoy less ie. practical design over writing of essays and reports. Although researching and learning is exciting, the writing is an area I continue to struggle with but hope that with better planning and more practice at writing reports and essays, these will seem less of a chore. </p>
    <p>Linked to this is my burst of enthusiasm at the initial stages of an exciting project and my impatience when a project is not finished within a short timescale. If further research is required or I encounter a problem then my motivation levels decrease and productivity suffers. I must use the planning and organisation tools more effectively in order to pace my progress and have a realistic timescale attached to each project. </p>
    <p>The lectures and tutorials from Units 2 - 8 invited me to think more about the analysis phase of the design process. I have enjoyed this part of the course because the analysis phase is very learner-focused and, for me, I enjoy the interaction with other students and lecturers. In this way I gain invaluable feedback and a chance to discuss ideas and concepts with like-minded people. For example, my view of professional relationships has been given more clarity due to the opportunities I’ve had to discuss this subject with others.</p>
    <p>As I throw myself into the study of experiential design, I remain focused on the Interactive Media Design framework on which the course is based. I also keep in mind my future career goal, which is to work as an interactive media or web designer. My intention is to obtain as much from the course as possible in order to become a rounded designer with a variety of experiences to draw from.</p>
  <p>To me design is about fun and about self-expression. Design is also my business.</p>
