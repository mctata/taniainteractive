      <p>The medium I have chosen to showcase my assignment is a website format as this allows me to express my ideas and be playful with style in an area of design I am passionate about. Evidencing the knowledge I have gained about simplicity in navigation and theory of colour, I have designed this interface in contemporary colours, taking into account modern fashion for vibrant colours against a dark background. Pattern, reflections and subtle glows have been used to enhance the reader experience and the logo is continued on each page and on coursework documents to identify the work as distinctively belonging to me.</p>
      <p>The site is split into three key areas; the use of colour to create emotional impact, design and critical evaluation of an interface and, critique of the design process, within this the relationship between designer and client is highlighted.  The portfolio will also include the reflection of what I have learnt throughout the module and how this could be applied to the development of interactive systems, in this case websites. </p>
      <p>Colour plays a key role in providing atmosphere and evoking emotional response within websites. I will begin by providing a brief account of how colour is formed and perceived.  I will evidence the importance of considered selection of colour by referencing studies and looking into the psychological theory of colour and how it is perceived. </p>
      <p>The interface I have selected to evaluate is a website I am currently working on with a client starting an e-commerce business called Impoindo. This interface has developed over several months and has not yet reached completion so this evaluation has acted as an important tool in assessing the progress and future plans for the site. I will look at the importance of colour, style, brand identity and coherence of navigation with relevance to the target client. </p>
      <p>The third area I have critiqued is the design process, in particular, the relationship between the designer and client throughout this process. I have marked out the key steps in the design process beginning with formulating a design strategy based on interviews with the client and market research, following this through to draft layouts, identity and logo. I have evidenced how planning and organisation are vital elements for both the client and designer and expectations need to be clearly established from the beginning.  To end, I have identified lessons learnt and mistakes made during my first professional experience with a client and how these have influenced my current practice.</p>
